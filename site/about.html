            <p>
              I am a ceramic artist devoted to process—years of sustained practice at the kiln, in the
              studio, and in the patient discipline of craft. My work is shaped by material attention:
              clay pushed to its edge, surfaces marked by fire, and forms built through repetition
              until they become their own language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nature is my ongoing teacher. Immersed in wild landscapes and shifting light, I return
              to the studio with a desire to honor what I observe—growth, erosion, quiet resilience,
              and the beauty that emerges through time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of my installations assemble ceramic spheres with industrial chain, linking
              individual forms into expansive, suspended fields. Each sphere holds its own presence,
              but together they speak more loudly: a portrait of interconnectivity—how we are bound
              to one another, how our lives carry weight, and how a collective can hold a significance
              larger than any single part. In The Little Prince, the fox teaches that relationship is
              created through time, ritual, and attention—and that it carries responsibility. That
              idea lives at the center of my practice: each work is something I have patiently “tamed”
              through devotion to craft, and in return it asks for stewardship, care, and integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suspended in space, the installations invite the body to slow down and look—how light
              passes through links, how shadows stitch themselves across walls, how mass can feel
              weightless. I hope the work carries both tenderness and gravity, offering a quiet place
              to sense connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work becomes an embodied metaphor for legacy: one voice, joined to many, shaping a
              shared story across space. I am multidisciplinary, and alongside sculpture I write
              poetry—another way I build meaning through rhythm, attention, and the lived texture of
              the world.
            </p>
