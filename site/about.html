            <p>
              I am a ceramic artist devoted to process—years of sustained practice at the kiln, in the
              studio, and in the patient discipline of craft. My work begins with material attention:
              clay pushed to its edge, surfaces altered by fire, and forms built through repetition
              until they become their own language. I return, again and again, to the unity Barbara
              Hepworth describes—a “perfect unity between the idea, the substance and the dimension”—
              because that unity is what allows scale to feel honest rather than inflated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nature is my ongoing teacher. Immersed in wild landscapes and shifting light, I come back
              to the studio with a desire to honor what I observe—growth, erosion, quiet resilience, and
              the beauty that gathers through time. These rhythms shape how I think about proportion,
              density, and the way a form can carry both stillness and movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of my installations assemble ceramic spheres with industrial chain, linking individual
              forms into expansive, suspended fields. Each sphere holds its own presence; together they
              become a larger system—an image of interdependence, of lives bound through contact and
              attention. Suspended in space, the work asks the body to slow down and look: light passing
              through links, shadows stitching across walls, mass made buoyant through balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scale is something I build physically. I assemble and calibrate work at height, attentive
              to how it holds air, how it changes a room, and how it meets the viewer’s body at human
              distance. And still, there is always a variable beyond control: the kiln leaves its own
              signature—atmosphere, ash, heat, time—making every sphere unmistakably singular within the
              whole.
