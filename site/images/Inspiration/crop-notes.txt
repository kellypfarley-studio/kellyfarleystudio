Inspiration image crop notes (Start a Project page)

Display box:
- Desktop (max width): about 480px wide x 420px tall
- Medium screens: about 440px wide x 380px tall
- Small screens: about 320px wide x 280px tall

Recommended crop ratio:
- 8:7 (1.14)
- Example sizes: 1140x1000, 1520x1330, 2280x2000

Framing tips:
- Keep the focal point centered.
- Leave a little breathing room at the edges so object-fit: cover doesn’t trim important details.
